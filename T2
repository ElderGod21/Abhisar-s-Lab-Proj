        <p>
            Home, as we call it, is the third planet from the Sun and the only place in the universe known to harbor
            life.While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid
            surface water.
            Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and
            rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's
            surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges,
            volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the
            magnetosphere of the Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.
